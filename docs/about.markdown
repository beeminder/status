Beeminder is a goal tracking tool that helps you stay on track towards
your goals by charging you a fee when you don't do your scheduled
work towards the goal.

We like to think of it as levying a tax on unproductive behavior on yourself.

You can find out more on our
[blog](https://blog.beeminder.com),
or in the 
[forum](https://forum.beeminder.com). 
And of course, at 
[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com)
itself, though that is likely down right now, since you're 
visiting the status pages...
